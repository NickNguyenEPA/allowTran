COPYRIGHT STATUS

The bulk of this code is copyright by members of or all of the R Core
Team.  ('The R Core Team' in copyright statements in individual files
refers to some or all of the team.)

See the file COPYING for the exact conditions under which you may
redistribute it.  R as a whole is distributed under GPL version 2 or
3: most source files contain a copyright statement allowing use of
that file under GPL version 2 or later: the main exceptions are the
included versions of packages 'MASS', 'class', 'nnet', 'rpart' and
'spatial' (GPL-2 or GPL-3).  (The auxiliary file m4/openmp.m4 is under
GPL-3, but its incorporation into 'configure' is not.)

The status of files used only in the Windows port is in file
src/gnuwin32/COPYRIGHTS.win, which is appended to this file in binary
Windows distributions.

Note that almost all the code *is* copyright and may only be
reproduced if the copyright notice (that in the file or this notice)
is preserved.  The status of the included LINPACK routines is unclear:
they are said to be in the public domain in the USA.

	---------------------------------------------------

Some (but not all) of the public header files are distributed under
the more permissive terms of version 2.1 or later of the LGPL: see
files R_HOME/share/licenses/LGPL-2.1 and R_HOME/share/licenses/LGPL-3.
This applies only to the header files

src/include/R.h
src/include/Rdefines.h
src/include/Rgraphics.h
src/include/Rinternals.h
src/include/Rmath.h
src/include/R_ext/*.h

Note that it does not apply to the header files such as Rembedded.h
and Rinterface.h used for third-party front ends.

From the announcement of the change (2001-Feb-05)

    It came to our attention that some projects are interpreting GPL to
    mean that compiling against the header files or linking against a
    Windows import library brings the compiled code under the scope of
    GPL.  This would mean it would be impossible to distribute binary
    versions of non-GPL packages with compiled code which called entry
    points in the R executable or DLL, of which there are many on CRAN.

    We encourage packages to be distributed under Open Source conditions,
    but accept that this is not possible for some contributions.  Our
    intention is that export files and import libraries be 'accessors'
    under clause 5 of the LGPL, so that in most cases no (additional)
    restrictions are imposed by compiling a package using the LGPL-ed
    components of R.

    To avoid any anomalies, the versions of the same files in R versions
    1.0.0 to 1.2.1 may also be used under LGPL or GPL.

Import libraries are no longer used under Windows.

Some contributed files are also covered by the Library General Public License.
These include (see also below)

src/library/stats/R/embed.R
src/library/stats/src/PPsum.c

BINARY DISTRIBUTIONS of R
=========================

The rest of this file applies only to binary distributions of R, and
in most cases only to those which have been built with static
libraries (as is done on Windows and macOS).  Information specific to
distributions for Windows is in file src/gnuwin32/COPYRIGHTS.win,
appended to this file on that platform.  (R distributions for macOS
link to the system ICU library, unlike on Windows.)

Binary distributions of R may include compiled code from the PCRE2
library whose licence is:

EXEMPTION FOR BINARY LIBRARY-LIKE PACKAGES
------------------------------------------

The second condition in the BSD licence (covering binary redistributions) does
not apply all the way down a chain of software. If binary package A includes
PCRE2, it must respect the condition, but if package B is software that
includes package A, the condition is not imposed on package B unless it uses
PCRE2 independently.


Or they may include compiled code from the PCRE library whose licence
is:

Binary components
-----------------

The Windows binary distribution contains components that have been
compiled separately.  Most of these are from the Rtools distribution
at https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/;
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/Rtools.txt lists the current
contents.

The build of Tcl/Tk contained in the binary installer was produced
by Adrian Waddell; see https://github.com/waddella/Tclbuild for 
instructions.  Sources are available via links on that page, or on
request from R-windows@r-project.org.

Rbitmap.dll is built against static libraries for libpng, jpeg and
libtiff: the Makefiles and configuration headers used are in the
src/gnuwin32/bitmap direcctory.  The exact sources used for these
libraries are available on request to R-windows@r-project.org (you
will need to specify which binary installer version).

A binary build may contain compiled sources from cairographics,
distributed under LGPL 2.1 (our choice) or MPL 1.1.

	---------------------------------------------------

Binary distributions of R will include compiled code from the
mingw-w64 project whose license at

https://github.com/mirror/mingw-w64/blob/master/COPYING

  OCB is covered by several patents but may be used freely by most
  software.  See http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/ocb/license.htm .
  In particular license 1 is suitable for Libgcrypt: See
  http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/ocb/license1.pdf for the full
  license document; it basically says:

    License 1 — License for Open-Source Software Implementations of OCB
                (Jan 9, 2013)

    Under this license, you are authorized to make, use, and
    distribute open-source software implementations of OCB. This
    license terminates for you if you sue someone over their
    open-source software implementation of OCB claiming that you have
    a patent covering their implementation.



 License for Open Source Software Implementations of OCB
 January 9, 2013

 1 Definitions

 1.1 “Licensor” means Phillip Rogaway.

 1.2 “Licensed Patents” means any patent that claims priority to United
 States Patent Application No. 09/918,615 entitled “Method and Apparatus
 for Facilitating Efficient Authenticated Encryption,” and any utility,
 divisional, provisional, continuation, continuations-in-part, reexamination,
 reissue, or foreign counterpart patents that may issue with respect to the
 aforesaid patent application. This includes, but is not limited to, United
 States Patent No. 7,046,802; United States Patent No. 7,200,227; United
 States Patent No. 7,949,129; United States Patent No. 8,321,675 ; and any
 patent that issues out of United States Patent Application No. 13/669,114.

 1.3 “Use” means any practice of any invention claimed in the Licensed Patents.

 1.4 “Software Implementation” means any practice of any invention
 claimed in the Licensed Patents that takes the form of software executing on
 a user-programmable, general-purpose computer or that takes the form of a
 computer-readable medium storing such software. Software Implementation does
 not include, for example, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs),
 field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), embedded systems, or IP cores.

 1.5 “Open Source Software” means software whose source code is published
 and made available for inspection and use by anyone because either (a) the
 source code is subject to a license that permits recipients to copy, modify,
 and distribute the source code without payment of fees or royalties, or
 (b) the source code is in the public domain, including code released for
 public use through a CC0 waiver. All licenses certified by the Open Source
 Initiative at opensource.org as of January 9, 2013 and all Creative Commons
 licenses identified on the creativecommons.org website as of January 9,
 2013, including the Public License Fallback of the CC0 waiver, satisfy these
 requirements for the purposes of this license.

 1.6 “Open Source Software Implementation” means a Software
 Implementation in which the software implicating the Licensed Patents is
 Open Source Software. Open Source Software Implementation does not include
 any Software Implementation in which the software implicating the Licensed
 Patents is combined, so as to form a larger program, with software that is
 not Open Source Software.

 2 License Grant

 2.1 License. Subject to your compliance with the term s of this license,
 including the restriction set forth in Section 2.2, Licensor hereby
 grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
 non-sublicenseable, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable license to practice
 any invention claimed in the Licensed Patents in any Open Source Software
 Implementation.

 2.2 Restriction. If you or your affiliates institute patent litigation
 (including, but not limited to, a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
 against any entity alleging that any Use authorized by this license
 infringes another patent, then any rights granted to you under this license
 automatically terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

 3 Disclaimer
 YOUR USE OF THE LICENSED PATENTS IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND UNLESS REQUIRED
 BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
 KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED PATENTS OR ANY PRODUCT EMBODYING ANY LICENSED
 PATENT, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUT ORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
 LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY
 CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE,
 ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO ANY USE OF THE LICENSED PATENTS, INCLUDING,
 WITHOUT LIMITATION, DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
 OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
 SUCH DAMAGES PRIOR TO SUCH AN OCCURRENCE.

 #
 #  A large portion of the dictionary entries
 #  originate from ICOT Free Software.  The following conditions for ICOT
 #  Free Software applies to the current dictionary as well.
 #
 #  Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its
 #  original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED
 #  that the provisions of Section 3 ("NO WARRANTY") will ALWAYS appear
 #  on, or be attached to, the Program, which is distributed substantially
 #  in the same form as set out herein and that such intended
 #  distribution, if actually made, will neither violate or otherwise
 #  contravene any of the laws and regulations of the countries having
 #  jurisdiction over the User or the intended distribution itself.
 #
 #  NO WARRANTY
 #
 #  The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the
 #  research and development conducted during the project and is provided
 #  to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the
 #  program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,
 #  implied, statutory or otherwise.  The term "warranty" used herein
 #  includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,
 #  performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of
 #  the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of
 #  any right of any third party.
 #
 #  Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to
 #  have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for
 #  the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or
 #  otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.
 #
 #  Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other
 #  organization that participated in or was otherwise related to the
 #  development of the program and their respective officials, directors,
 #  officers and other employees shall be held liable for any and all
 #  damages, including, without limitation, general, special, incidental
 #  and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection
 #  with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material
 #  or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,
 #  regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had
 #  knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the
 #  project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the
 #  foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term
 #  "use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,
 #  modification, copying and distribution of the program and the
 #  production of secondary products from the program.
 #
 #  In the case where the program, whether in its original form or
 #  modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from
 #  any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or
 #  grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in
 #  writing, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted
 #  from and not be held liable to the user for any such damages as noted
 #  above as far as the program is concerned.

Time Zone Database

  ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone
Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database
is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone
Database section 7.

 # 7.  Database Ownership
 #
 #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
 #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
 #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the
 #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do
 #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make
 #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ
 #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA
 #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of
 #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance
 #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made
 #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person
 #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to
 #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.
