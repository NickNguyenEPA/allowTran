Description: Tooling to group dates by a variety of periods including:
    yearly, monthly, by second, by week of the month, and more.  The
    groups are defined in such a way that they also represent the distance
    between dates in terms of the period. This extracts valuable
    information that can be used in further calculations that rely on a
    specific temporal spacing between observations.
